Group 02 Midterm Project ALGORITHM

We keep track of the current time.
We have a list called events to store event details.
There are two possible statuses for event: 'approved' or 'cancelled'.
Show a menu for an Event Management System, like
(1.Display events, 2.Book a new event, 3.Update an existing event, 4.Change the status of an event, 5.Delete an event, Exit the program)
User's choice, perform the corresponding action:
Display events if the user chooses option 1.
Book a new event if the user chooses option 2.
Update an existing event if the user chooses option 3.
Change the status of an event if the user chooses option 4.
Delete an event if the user chooses option 5.
Exit the program if the user chooses option 6.
If the user enters an invalid choice, we prompt them to choose a valid option.
